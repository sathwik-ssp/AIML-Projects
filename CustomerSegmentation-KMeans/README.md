📌 Project Overview
👉This project performs Customer Segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customers Dataset.
👉The idea is to group customers into distinct segments based on two important features:
      1. Annual Income
      2. Spending Score
👉These segments help businesses understand customer behaviour and build targeted marketing strategies.

📂 Dataset Information
👉The dataset used is Mall_Customers.csv, containing the following columns:
      1.CustomerID
      2.Gender
      3.Age
      4.Annual Income (k$)
      5.Spending Score (1–100)
👉For clustering, only the following features were used:
      1. Annual Income
      2. Spending Score

🧠 Techniques Used
👉K-Means Clustering
👉Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
👉Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
👉Pandas & NumPy for data handling
